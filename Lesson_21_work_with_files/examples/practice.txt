If you can keep your head when all about you
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can think and not make thoughts your aim
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster 
And treat those two impostors just the same 
If you can bear to hear the truth you ve spoken 
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools 
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, 
And stoop and build them up with worn-out tools:


Kipling. If
